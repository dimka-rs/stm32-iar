@par Example Description

This directory provides a reference  project that can be used to build any firmware application for
STM32L0xx devices using STM32CubeL0 HAL and running on STM32L0xx_Discovery board from STMicroelectronics
to display pictures on the embedded EPAPER module. 

One workspace is provided for STM32L0xx_Discovery board.
This workspace includes the right set of peripherals, linker and startup files.


@par Directory contents 

  - EPAPER_Display/Src/main.c                 Main program
  - EPAPER_Display/Src/system_STM32L0xx.c     STM32L0xx system clock configuration file
  - EPAPER_Display/Src/STM32L0xx_it.c         Interrupt handlers 
  - EPAPER_Display/Src/STM32L0xx_hal_msp.c    HAL MSP module
  - EPAPER_Display/Inc/main.h                 Main program header file  
  - EPAPER_Display/Inc/STM32L0xx_hal_conf.h   HAL Configuration file
  - EPAPER_Display/Inc/STM32L0xx_it.h         Interrupt handlers header file
  - EPAPER_Display/Inc/picture.h              Constant coding each picture to display
  

        
@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32L0xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L0xx_Discovery board  
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
